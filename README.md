# blackjack
Blackjack is the first iOS app I made on my own using swiftUI in xcode. I used multiple video tutorials and read about SwiftUI online to learn how to program in xcode. I made my first app, the card game war, by following an online tutorial, and used that as inspiration for my Blackjack game. I started by first creating an initial user interface for the app then writing the program for it. I had some difficulty with image sizing and buggy code, but I cleaned up the code by implementing functions and soon the game was functional. I then continued working to improve the app, adding features such as a player money balance that increased/decreased based on their game result. I also learned how to add sound effects to the app, which is one of my favorite feautures. If I have the chance to continue to improve the game, I'd like to add a title screen that the user is taken to before the actual game screen, and a how-to-play screen with instructions. I'd also like the user to be able to see the cards in the dealer's hand so the app more closely resembles an actual blackjack game.
